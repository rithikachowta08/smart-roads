download raspbian stretch img file
format sd card using sd card formatter. 
write raspbian.img to drive using win32 disk imager
insert sd, connect to router 
boot
wait a while for raspbian to install
add "ssh" file to sd card with no extension

arp -a
ssh into ip with x11 forwarding after launching xming
login as pi with raspberry as password
startlxde


when ip address was not getting assigned:
solution 1: (when pi connected to router)
added ip=192.168.1.6 in boot/cmdline.txt of sd card
booted as usual
ssh into 192.168.1.6 after launching xming

solution 2: (when pi connected to laptop)
connected pi to laptop
wifi connection should be shared 
configure ethernet ipv4 address to 192.168.1.13
boot pi
ssh into 192.168.1.6 (ip in cmdline.txt)


when name resolution fails:

follow this link word for word. method 1.

//OTHER OPTIONS

- ssd model -- works but sticky detection
- andrew sobral bg -- inaccurate -- to execute, open 
simple_vehicle_counting.sln in vs and build in release mode
copy simple_vehicle_counting.exe from /build to outer dir and execute. edit demo.cpp to change code
- ozcano hog -- works not that accurate -- to try on pi/ubuntu
to execute, follow last few steps in installing opencv on windows

//TO-DO


- study all viva questions 
- optimize opencv code and increase FPS 
- train for trucks
